% Purpose: Segmentation
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Run the k-means clustering algorithm.
%
% INPUTS
% X - An array of size m x n containing the points to cluster. Each row is
%     an n-dimensional point, so X(i, :) gives the coordinates of the ith
%     point.
% k - The number of clusters to compute.
% visualize2D - OPTIONAL parameter telling whether or not to visualize the
%               progress of the algorithm for 2D data. If not set then 2D
%               data will not be visualized.
% centers - OPTIONAL parameter giving initial centers for the clusters.
%           If provided, centers should be a k x n matrix where
%           centers(c, :) is the center of the cth cluster. If not provided
%           then cluster centers will be initialized by selecting random
%           rows of X. You don't need to use this parameter; it is mainly
%           here to make your code more easily testable.
%
% OUTPUTS
% idx     - The assignments of points to clusters. idx(i) = c means that the
%           point X(i, :) has been assigned to cluster c.

    if ~isa(X, 'double')
        X = double(X);
    end
    m = size(X, 1);
    n = size(X, 2);
    
    % If we are going to display the clusters graphically then create a
    % figure in which to draw the visualization.
    figHandle = [];
    if n == 2 && visualize2D
        figHandle = figure;
    end

    
    % If initial cluster centers were not provided then initialize cluster
    % centers to random rows of X. Each row of the centers variable should
    % contain the center of a cluster, so that centers(c, :) is the center
    % of the cth cluster.
    if ~exist('centers', 'var')
        centers = zeros(k, n);
